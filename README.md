Just like any regular day, I was working on something. This time during a Live Stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/CodeWithAhsan) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/CodeWithAhsan) when I couldn't find a great typescript + webpack starter template that's minimal, up to date, and works! So I created this one.

And here is the accompanied [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JKGGMD4fXk).
